* sleeper

A deamon to keep track of your computer usage.

It tries to figure it out by:
- Checking changes of status on X11 DPMS
- Checking for system suspensions
- Checking your battery connection status (using upower)

It needs to run as a daemon, since there is no system log for DPMS or battery status changes.

It will print to stdout (journalctl) and into 2 files
- ~/.cache/awaketime
- ~/.cache/sleeptime

** Installation

#+begin_src
$ make
$ cp sleeper ~/bin/
$ cp sleeper.service ~/.config/systemd/user
$ systemctl --user enable sleeper
$ systemctl --user start sleeper
#+end_src
