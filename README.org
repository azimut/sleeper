* sleeper

A deamon to keep track of how long you have been awake, by tracking your computer usage.

It tries to figure it out by checking:

- changes of status on X11 DPMS
- system suspensions
- system shutdowns (utmp)
- battery connection status (upower)

It has to run as a daemon, since there are no system logs for some of these.

Prints to stdout (journalctl) and into 2 files.

- ~/.cache/awaketime
- ~/.cache/sleeptime

** Installation

#+begin_src
$ vim src/config.h # change the filepath where the sqlite3 database will be saved
$ make deps
$ make
$ make install
$ systemctl --user enable sleeper
#+end_src
