* sleeper

A deamon to keep track of your computer usage.

It tries to figure it out by:
- Checking changes of status on X11 DPMS
- Checking for system suspensions
- Checking your battery connection status (using upower)

It needs to run as a daemon, since there is no system log for DPMS or battery status changes.

It will print to stdout (journalctl) and into 2 files
- ~/.cache/awaketime
- ~/.cache/sleeptime

** Installation

#+begin_src
psql> CREATE DATABASE activity;
$ make deps
$ make
$ make install
$ systemctl --user enable sleeper
#+end_src
